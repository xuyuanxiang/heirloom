My pure, reusable toolbox for front-end projects written in ES6 without any third party frameworks.

Comming soon... I'm coding with my poor time from work. So it's really a long journey.

Now, It contains: 

+ Common: 

	A series of reusable pure functions continues to increase...
+ REST: 

	Provides interaction support with RESTful services.
+ Retry: 
  
  Take `Simple Retry Policy` and `Fixed Back Off Policy` to catch a function's error and try to recover it's expected state.
  
+ Cache:  Cache Policy.

	+ store: Memory, Local Storage... 
	+ policy: LRU, FIFO...
	
+ Which is next?

`REST` and `Retry` were inspired by the excellent [Spring]() framework.
